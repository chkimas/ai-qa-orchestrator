**ARGUS** is an autonomous, full-stack **Neural Watchman** designed for the modern web ecosystem. Moving beyond brittle, selector-based scripts, ARGUS utilizes a **Multi-Model Neural Core** to perceive, reason, and heal web automation in real-time.

## 🛡️ Tactical Mission Modules

- **🎯 Sniper Mode:** Natural language intent to deterministic execution. Features **Neural Healing** to re-map broken selectors autonomously.
- **👁️ Scout Mode:** Autonomous "Spider" that maps routes, captures UI state, and identifies "Brittle Zones" without human intervention.
- **🔥 Chaos Monkey:** Adversarial testing via AI-generated destructive payloads (XSS, SQLi, overflows) to find system breaking points.
- **🔄 Behavioral Replay:** Promote successful "Scout" missions to the **Golden Path Registry** for continuous regression monitoring.

## 🔒 Security: The Vault Pattern

ARGUS implements a strict **Zero-Knowledge Vault Handshake**. Your AI provider keys are encrypted at the browser level using **AES-256-CBC** before being dispatched to the worker. Only the worker, armed with your unique `VAULT_MASTER_KEY` during runtime, can unlock the "Intelligence" for the duration of the mission.

## ⚠️ Known Limitations & Third-Party Services

This project is built using the **Free Tier** offerings of our ecosystem partners. Consequently, the following constraints apply:

- **Hugging Face:** Worker nodes may enter "Sleep Mode" during inactivity. The first mission request may trigger a "Wake-Up" delay.
- **Supabase:** Real-time log streaming is subject to free-tier connection concurrency limits.
- **Vercel / Clerk:** Server Action timeouts and authentication session limits are governed by standard free-tier policies.
- **API Quotas:** Mission frequency is limited by the rate-limits of your configured providers (Gemini/Groq).
